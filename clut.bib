	abstract = {The topic of preferences is a new branch of machine learning and data mining, and it has attracted considerable attention in artificial intelligence research in recent years. Representing and processing knowledge in terms of preferences is appealing as it allows one to specify desires in a declarative way, to combine qualitative and quantitative modes of reasoning, and to deal with inconsistencies and exceptions in a flexible manner. Preference learning is concerned with the acquisition of preference models from data – it involves learning from observations that reveal information about the preferences of an individual or a class of individuals, and building models that generalize beyond such training data. This is the first book dedicated to this topic, and the treatment is comprehensive. The editors first offer a thorough introduction, including a systematic categorization according to learning task and learning technique, along with a unified notation. The remainder of the book is organized into parts that follow the developed framework, complementing survey articles with in-depth treatises of current research topics in this area. The book will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning and data mining, and in fields such as multicriteria decision-making and operations research.},

	abstract = {Multicriteria sorting methods aim at assigning alternatives to one of the predefined ordered categories. We consider a sorting method in which categories are defined by profiles separating consecutive categories. An alternative a is assigned to the lowest category for which a is at least as good as the lower profile of this category, for a majority of weighted criteria. This method, that we call MR-Sort, corresponds to a simplified version of ELECTRE Tri. To elicit the values for the profiles and weights, we consider a learning procedure. This procedure relies on a set of known assignment examples to find parameters compatible with these assignments. This is done using mathematical programming techniques.
The focus of this study is experimental. In order to test the mathematical formulation and the parameters learning method, we generate random samples of simulated alternatives. We perform experiments in view of answering the following questions: (a) assuming the learning set is generated using a MR-Sort model, is the learning method able to restore the original sorting model? (b) is the learning method able to do so even when the learning set contains errors? (c) is MR-Sort model able to represent a learning set generated with another sorting method, i.e. can the models be discriminated on an empirical basis?},

	abstract = {Outranking relations such as produced by the Electre I or II or the Tactic methods are based on a concordance and non-discordance principle that leads to declaring that an alternative is “superior” to another, if the coalition of attributes supporting this proposition is “sufficiently important” (concordance condition) and if there is no attribute that “strongly rejects” it (non-discordance condition). Such a way of comparing alternatives is rather natural and does not require a detailed analysis of tradeoffs between the various attributes. However, it is well known that it may produce binary relations that do not possess any remarkable property of transitivity or completeness. The axiomatic foundations of outranking relations have recently received attention. Within a conjoint measurement framework, characterizations of reflexive concordance–discordance relations have been obtained. These relations encompass those generated by the Electre I and II methods, which are non-strict (reflexive) relations. A different characterization has been provided for strict (asymmetric) preference relations such as produced by Tactic. In this paper we briefly review the various kinds of axiomatizations of outranking relations proposed so far in the literature. Then we analyze the relationships between reflexive and asymmetric outranking relations in a conjoint measurement framework, consolidating our previous work. Co-duality plays an essential rôle in our analysis. It allows us to understand the correspondence between the previous characterizations. Making a step further, we provide a common axiomatic characterization for both types of relations. Applying the co-duality operator to concordance–discordance relations also yields a new and interesting type of preference relation that we call concordance relation with bonus. The axiomatic characterization of such relations results directly from co-duality arguments.},

	abstract = {As decision-aiding tools become more popular everyday—but at the same time more sophisticated—it is of utmost importance to develop their explanatory capabilities. Some decisions require careful explanations, which can be challenging to provide when the underlying mathematical model is complex. This is the case when recommendations are based on incomplete expression of preferences, as the decision-aiding tool has to infer despite this scarcity of information. This step is key in the process but hardly intelligible for the user. The robust additive utility model is a necessary preference relation which makes minimal assumptions, at the price of handling a collection of compatible utility functions, virtually impossible to exhibit to the user. This strength for the model is a challenge for the explanation. In this paper, we come up with an explanation engine based on sequences of preference swaps, that is, pairwise comparison of alternatives. The intuition is to confront the decision maker with “elementary” comparisons, thus building incremental explanations. Elementary here means that alternatives compared may only differ on two criteria. Technically, our explanation engine exploits some properties of the necessary preference relation that we unveil in the paper. Equipped with this, we explore the issues of the existence and length of the resulting sequences. We show in particular that in the general case, no bound can be given on the length of explanations, but that in binary domains, the sequences remain short.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of learning a function assigning objects into ordered categories. The objects are described by a vector of attribute values and the assignment function is monotone w.r.t. the attribute values (monotone sorting problem). Our approach is based on a model used in multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), called MR-Sort. This model determines the assigned class on the basis of a majority rule and an artificial object that is a typical lower profile of the category. MR-Sort is a simplified variant of the ELECTRE TRI method. We describe an algorithm designed for learning such a model on the basis of assignment examples. We compare its performance with choquistic regression, a method recently proposed in the preference learning community, and with UTADIS, another MCDA method leaning on an additive value function (utility) model. Our experimentation shows that MR-Sort competes with the other two methods, and leads to a model that is interpretable.},
