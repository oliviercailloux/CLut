Recommender systems are a special class of user support tools that act in cooperation with users, complementing their abilities and augmenting their performance by offering proactive or on-demand, context-sensitive support. Recommender systems are mostly based on machine learning and information retrieval algorithms, providing typically suggestions based on quantitative evidence (i.e. measures of similarity between objects or users). The inference process which led to such suggestions is mostly unknown (i.e. ‘black-box’ metaphor). Although the effectiveness of existing recommenders is remarkable, they still have some serious limitations.},

	abstract = {The topic of preferences is a new branch of machine learning and data mining, and it has attracted considerable attention in artificial intelligence research in recent years. Representing and processing knowledge in terms of preferences is appealing as it allows one to specify desires in a declarative way, to combine qualitative and quantitative modes of reasoning, and to deal with inconsistencies and exceptions in a flexible manner. Preference learning is concerned with the acquisition of preference models from data – it involves learning from observations that reveal information about the preferences of an individual or a class of individuals, and building models that generalize beyond such training data. This is the first book dedicated to this topic, and the treatment is comprehensive. The editors first offer a thorough introduction, including a systematic categorization according to learning task and learning technique, along with a unified notation. The remainder of the book is organized into parts that follow the developed framework, complementing survey articles with in-depth treatises of current research topics in this area. The book will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning and data mining, and in fields such as multicriteria decision-making and operations research.},

	abstract = {Multicriteria sorting methods aim at assigning alternatives to one of the predefined ordered categories. We consider a sorting method in which categories are defined by profiles separating consecutive categories. An alternative a is assigned to the lowest category for which a is at least as good as the lower profile of this category, for a majority of weighted criteria. This method, that we call MR-Sort, corresponds to a simplified version of ELECTRE Tri. To elicit the values for the profiles and weights, we consider a learning procedure. This procedure relies on a set of known assignment examples to find parameters compatible with these assignments. This is done using mathematical programming techniques.
The focus of this study is experimental. In order to test the mathematical formulation and the parameters learning method, we generate random samples of simulated alternatives. We perform experiments in view of answering the following questions: (a) assuming the learning set is generated using a MR-Sort model, is the learning method able to restore the original sorting model? (b) is the learning method able to do so even when the learning set contains errors? (c) is MR-Sort model able to represent a learning set generated with another sorting method, i.e. can the models be discriminated on an empirical basis?},

	abstract = {As decision-aiding tools become more popular everyday—but at the same time more sophisticated—it is of utmost importance to develop their explanatory capabilities. Some decisions require careful explanations, which can be challenging to provide when the underlying mathematical model is complex. This is the case when recommendations are based on incomplete expression of preferences, as the decision-aiding tool has to infer despite this scarcity of information. This step is key in the process but hardly intelligible for the user. The robust additive utility model is a necessary preference relation which makes minimal assumptions, at the price of handling a collection of compatible utility functions, virtually impossible to exhibit to the user. This strength for the model is a challenge for the explanation. In this paper, we come up with an explanation engine based on sequences of preference swaps, that is, pairwise comparison of alternatives. The intuition is to confront the decision maker with “elementary” comparisons, thus building incremental explanations. Elementary here means that alternatives compared may only differ on two criteria. Technically, our explanation engine exploits some properties of the necessary preference relation that we unveil in the paper. Equipped with this, we explore the issues of the existence and length of the resulting sequences. We show in particular that in the general case, no bound can be given on the length of explanations, but that in binary domains, the sequences remain short.},

The objects are described by a vector of attribute values and the assignment function is monotone w.r.t. the attribute values (monotone sorting problem). Our approach is based on a model used in multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), called MR-Sort. This model determines the assigned class on the basis of a majority rule and an artificial object that is a typical lower profile of the category. MR-Sort is a simplified variant of the ELECTRE TRI method. We describe an algorithm designed for learning such a model on the basis of assignment examples. We compare its performance with choquistic regression, a method recently proposed in the preference learning community, and with UTADIS, another MCDA method leaning on an additive value function (utility) model. Our experimentation shows that MR-Sort competes with the other two methods, and leads to a model that is interpretable.},

The main result shows that, in general, cancellation axioms of any order are required to ensure additive representability. More precisely, a generic family of counterexamples is provided, proving that the (m+1)st order cancellation axiom cannot be derived from the mth order cancellation axiom when m is even. However, a special case is considered in which the existence of additive representations can be derived from the independence axiom alone. Unlike the classical representation theorems, these representations are not unique up to strictly positive affine transformations, but follow Fishburn's (1981) uniqueness property.},

	abstract = {While the philosophical literature has extensively studied how decisions relate to arguments, reasons and justifications, decision theory almost entirely ignores the latter notions and rather focuses on preference and belief. In this article, we argue that decision theory can largely benefit from explicitly taking into account the stance that decision-makers take towards arguments and counter-arguments. To that end, we elaborate a formal framework aiming to integrate the role of arguments and argumentation in decision theory and decision aid. We start from a decision situation, where an individual requests decision support. In this context, we formally define, as a commendable basis for decision-aid, this individual's deliberated judgment, popularized by Rawls. We explain how models of deliberated judgment can be validated empirically. We then identify conditions upon which the existence of a valid model can be taken for granted, and analyze how these conditions can be relaxed. We then explore the significance of our proposed framework for decision aiding practice. We argue that our concept of deliberated judgment owes its normative credentials both to its normative foundations (the idea of rationality based on arguments) and to its reference to empirical reality (the stance that real, empirical individuals hold towards arguments and counter-arguments, on due reflection). We then highlight that our framework opens promising avenues for future research involving both philosophical and decision theoretic approaches, as well as empirical implementations.},

These systems passively track different sorts of user behavior, such as purchase history, watching habits and browsing activity, in order to model user preferences. Unlike the much more extensively researched explicit feedback, we do not have any direct input from the users regarding their preferences. In particular, we lack substantial evidence on which products consumer dislike. In this work we identify unique properties of implicit feedback datasets. We propose treating the data as indication of positive and negative preference associated with vastly varying confidence levels. This leads to a factor model which is especially tailored for implicit feedback recommenders. We also suggest a scalable optimization procedure, which scales linearly with the data size. The algorithm is used successfully within a recommender system for television shows. It compares favorably with well tuned implementations of other known methods. In addition, we offer a novel way to give explanations to recommendations given by this factor model.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899},
	abstract = {To make AI systems broadly useful for challenging real-world tasks, we need them to learn complex human goals and preferences. One approach to specifying complex goals asks humans to judge during training which agent behaviors are safe and useful, but this approach can fail if the task is too complicated for a human to directly judge. To help address this concern, we propose training agents via self play on a zero sum debate game. Given a question or proposed action, two agents take turns making short statements up to a limit, then a human judges which of the agents gave the most true, useful information. In an analogy to complexity theory, debate with optimal play can answer any question in PSPACE given polynomial time judges (direct judging answers only NP questions). In practice, whether debate works involves empirical questions about humans and the tasks we want AIs to perform, plus theoretical questions about the meaning of AI alignment. We report results on an initial MNIST experiment where agents compete to convince a sparse classifier, boosting the classifier's accuracy from 59.4\% to 88.9\% given 6 pixels and from 48.2\% to 85.2\% given 4 pixels. Finally, we discuss theoretical and practical aspects of the debate model, focusing on potential weaknesses as the model scales up, and we propose future human and computer experiments to test these properties.},
