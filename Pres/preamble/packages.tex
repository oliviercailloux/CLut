%“The \boldsymbol command is obtained preferably by using the bm package, which provides a newer, more powerful version than the one provided by the amsmath package. Generally speaking, it is ill-advised to apply \boldsymbol to more than one symbol at a time.” — AMS Short math guide. “If no bold font appears to be available for a particular symbol, \bm will use ‘poor man’s bold’” — bm. It is “best to load the package after any packages that define new symbol fonts” – bm. bm defines \boldsymbol as synonym to \bm. \boldmath accesses the correct font if it exists; it is used by \bm when appropriate. See https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/10643 and https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues/71 for some difficulties with \bm.
